Create 2 methods that perform the following similar task:

1st method needs to take 2 Strings called firstName, lastName and and print out
the full name in reverse order -> 
Example method calls:

("Joe", "Biden") -> Biden, Joe
("Eric", "Prydz") -> Prydz, Eric
("Green", "Velvet") -> Velvet, Green

2nd method needs to do the same exact thing as the 1st method except it returns the reverse full name as one String
instead of printing out;
